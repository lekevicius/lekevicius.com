# Lekevicius.com

Built used custom Gulp-based blog system (to be open sourced), custom CSS framework (to be open sourced) and a bunch of custom jQuery plugins (to be open sourced).

Feel free to explore how the site is built. I will write it up eventually on my blog, so you might want to subscribe. Cheers!
