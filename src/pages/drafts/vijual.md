Infinite Loop is a very simple, relaxing and never ending game for iPhone, iPad and Android. Your goal is to turn all forms on the grid so that there would be no open connections. Most levels are algorithmically generated and randomly colored, and after successfully completing each level you will be rewarded with a beautiful design of your own making.
