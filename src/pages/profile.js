        <p>Now 28 years old, living in Vilnius, Lithuania. I have been designing and developing for close to 15 years, and hold a BA degree in Graphic Design from Vilnius Academy of Arts.</p>
        <p>Currently I am independently designing and building new apps, trying to create something both useful and delightful.</p>
        <p>Previously I was Head of Product Design at health and beauty marketplace <a href="https://www.treatwell.com/">Treatwell</a> and co-founded an app design and development agency <a href="http://lemonlabs.co/">Lemon Labs</a> (later acquired by Treatwell). I have also been lecturing in <a href="http://www.dizainokolegija.lt/en/">Vilnius College of Design</a> and co-founded an analytics startup <a href="https://socilyzer.com/">Socilyzer</a>.</p>

        <hr />

        <p>As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to both design and code.</p>
        <p>As a designer, I have created over a hundred websites, a bunch of games, about 20 apps and 2 magazines. I've also dabbled in 3D, animation, procedural design, edited a couple of movies and even acted in a few. When designing, I focus on information architecture, typography, usability, simple user interface and interaction design.</p>
        <p>As a developer, I have been coding my own ideas all the time. It started with Flash games. I later switched to building websites, beginning at the time when tables were the new hotness, and journeying through CSS, XHTML, jQuery and now, React. At one time I worked as a Flash game builder, another time a Ruby on Rails developer.</p>
        <p>All the time, I love to play with new technologies. Building apps since that became possible, programming drones in 2013, now, experimenting with AR and deep learning. I love this and hope this crazy ride of new tech will never stop.</p>
