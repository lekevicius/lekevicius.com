  "The first big story of the year was the airstrike killing Gen. Suleimani, and the resulting [Conflict with Iran].",
  "[Conflict with Iran] dominated the headlines, with a lot of worry about a possible escalation to war. Iran downed a passenger jet.",
  "As it de-escalated, [Conflict with Iran] disappeared from the headlines. The biggest news of the week was the Senate taking up Trump‚Äôs [Impeachment] case. New debates in the [Democratic Primaries] race.",
  "With most news covering [Impeachment] trial, the very first mention of [Coronavirus] appeared on the front page: ‚ÄúFear of Pandemic Rises‚Äù mentioned ‚Äúat least 3 people dead‚Äù. First case in the US, and lockdown in Wuhan.",
  "Trump‚Äôs [Impeachment] news about witness blocking competed for attention against [Coronavirus]. US restricted travel from China.",
  "Iowa caucuses in [Democratic Primaries] and Trump‚Äôs acquittal in [Impeachment] trial dominated this week. [Coronavirus] news consistently appeared on every front page.",
  "From this week on, no new larger stories emerged. Sanders won New Hampshire in [Democratic Primaries], and the world focused on China battling the outbreak.",
  "Debates, and Sanders won Nevada in [Democratic Primaries]. Most of [Coronavirus] coverage was focused on Diamond Princess. Concerns over the threat of pandemic were raised.",
  "More debates in [Democratic Primaries]. [Coronavirus] coverage increased: Italy in lockdown, Pence tasked with leading the virus response force, and a big stock dive.",
  "Biden won Super Tuesday in [Democratic Primaries], Warren and Bloomberg left the race. Slight increase again in [Coronavirus] coverage.",
  "This was the week when [Coronavirus] decisively took over the news. Italy‚Äôs lockdown, stocks tumbling down even further, WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic.",
  "[Coronavirus] coverage turns to the US. Shelter-in-place orders, FED cutting interest rate to zero, and early discussions of a stimulus package.",
  "An exceptional week with every single article on the front page covering [Coronavirus]. Senate approved a $2T stimulus package, massive jobless claims, US became the country with the most cases.",
  "Another single-topic week, with almost all stories focusing on [Coronavirus]. Even more job losses, grim death estimates, New York overwhelmed with cases.",
  "[Coronavirus] maintained complete hold over the front page. What would be headline news during normal times, Sanders dropping out of the [Democratic Primaries] and making Biden a presumptive nominee, only got a sliver of the page.",
  "With [Coronavirus] cases still increasing rapidly, coverage turned to reopening, and who would be in power to command it.",
  "More [Coronavirus]-covered front pages. Topics included unattributed deaths, comparison between states and Trump pushing suspect cures.",
  "[Coronavirus] coverage continues. Reopening and expected shrinking of the economy were the most common threads.",
  "[Coronavirus] has impacted every aspect of our lives so much that it is unavoidable in nearly every story. The only article that broke the trend was about the Justice Department dropping Flynn‚Äôs case.",
  "While no story can compete with the hold [Coronavirus] has over the front pages, Flynn‚Äôs case appears on three of them.",

          <strong>Notes on the methodology:</strong> each 2020 New York Times front page has been annotated by single-theme stories that have consistently appeared for more than a week. Minor stories at the bottom of the front page have not been annotated. Coronavirus-related stories are not further split into subtopics (e.g. health, economics, or politics) because New York Times themselves don‚Äôt. The usual double-line marking hasn‚Äôt been used for Coronavirus, because articles often touch on multiple subtopics.

            <p>Before delving into more detail about each week, it‚Äôs worthwhile to take a bird eye‚Äôs view at the year so far, and how the news coverage transition happened on macro scale.</p>
            <p>The beginning of the year showed the usual cycle: there is usually one long-term story (<span className="ir">Conflict with Iran</span> for the first two weeks, <span className="im">Trump‚Äôs Impeachment</span> for the following three), but this story almost never fully covers the front page. As the story resolves, something else fills the void ‚Äî in this case more focus on the <span className="dp">Democratic Primaries</span> race.</p>
            <p><span className="cv">Coronavirus</span> does not fit this usual cycle. Starting with early March, almost every front page is exclusively covering the pandemic. These are not usual times ‚Äî and this project explores these unusual New York Times front pages.</p>
            <p>Below, you can read a Week by Week analysis, highlighting what topics where the most prominent each week.</p>
