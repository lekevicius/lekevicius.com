  "As it de-escalated, [Conflict with Iran] disappeared from headlines. The biggest news of the week was Senate taking up Trump‚Äôs [Impeachment] case. New debates in [Democratic Primaries] race.",
  "With most news covering [Impeachment] trial, the very first frontpage news about [Coronavirus] appeared: ‚ÄúFear of Pandemic Rises‚Äù mentioned ‚Äúat least 3 people dead‚Äù. First case in US, and lockdown of Wuhan.",
  "Trump‚Äôs [Impeachment] news about witness blocking tussled for attention with [Coronavirus]. US restricted travel from China.",
  "Iowa caucuses in [Democratic Primaries] and Trump‚Äôs acquittal in [Impeachment] trial dominated this week. [Coronavirus] news still appeared on every frontpage.",
  "From this week on, no new bigger stories emerged. Sanders won New Hampshire in [Democratic Primaries], and the world focused on China battling the outbreak.",
  "Debates, and Sanders won Nevada in [Democratic Primaries]. Most of [Coronavirus] coverage is about Diamond Princess. Concerns over the threat of pandemic raised.",
  "More debates in [Democratic Primaries]. [Coronavirus] coverage increased: Italy in lockdown, Pence tasked with leading virus response, and big stock dive.",
  "Biden won Super Tuesday in [Democratic Primaries], Warren and Bloomberg left the race. Slight increase in [Coronavirus] coverage.",
  "This was the week when [Coronavirus] decisively took over the news. Italy's lockdown, stocks tumbling down even further, WHO naming the outbreak a pandemic.",
  "[Coronavirus] coverage turns to US. Shelter in place orders, FED cutting interest rate to 0, and early discussions of a stimulus package.",
  "The only week when every single article on the frontpage, all week long, was only about the [Coronavirus]. Senate approved $2B package, massive jobless claims, US became a country with most cases.",
  "Another single-topic week, with almost all stories focusing on [Coronavirus]. Even more job losses, grim death estimates, New York overwhelmed with cases.",
  "[Coronavirus] maintained complete hold over the frontpage. What would be major news during normal years, Sanders dropping out of [Democratic Primaries] and making Biden a presumptive nominee, only got a sliver of the page.",
  "With [Coronavirus] cases still increasing rapidly, coverage turned to reopening, and who has the power to do so.",
  "More [Coronavirus]-covered frontpages. Topics included unaccounted deaths, comparison between states and Trump pushing suspect cures.",
  "[Coronavirus] coverage continues. Reopening and shrinking of economy was the most common thread.",
  "[Coronavirus] has impacted every aspect of life so much that it is unavoidable in almost every story. Only Justice Dept. dropping Flynn‚Äôs case breaked through.",

Small stories at the bottom of the frontpage are not annotated. Coronavirus-related stories are not split into sub-topics (health, economics, politics) because New York Times themselves don‚Äôt split them (they usually split story groups with double lines, not so with Coronavirus-related stories) and articles themselves often touch on multiple sub-topics.
