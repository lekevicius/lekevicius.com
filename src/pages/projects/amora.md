Amora is a slab serif designed for one of the study assignments in Vilnius Academy of Arts. The assignment was to design a "workhorse" font, something that could be used for typesetting a text of medium length, like an article.

I took this opportunity and committed to designing a full-featured font. Amora supports over 50 languages, includes hundreds of unique characters and maintains a consistent detail across all of its letters: a tapering serif. Itâ€™s a font somewhere in between a more classical and slab serif, echoing the taper not only in serifs, but all in counter spaces, stems, even punctuation.

Other details found in this font:

* Mostly consistent vertical rhythms in letters like m, n, u, e, and others.
* Monospaced numbers designed for tabular display
* A good number of ligatures
* Relatively low x-height that makes the font more suitable for small sizes.

Only one weight, Medium Roman, was designed. The font also lacks professional kerning. Amora was designed in Glyphs Pro.
