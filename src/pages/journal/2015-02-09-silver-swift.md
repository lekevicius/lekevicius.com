Very interesting project. Swift as a language is very modern and quite fun. Swift as an implementation and compiler is just remarkable. I'm sure that re-implementing it -- for Windows, .NET, Java and Android -- is an incredible task.

Just as Apple's Swift, this project is free, but not open source. I'm excited about the possibilities, but only real projects will show if it's comparable to Apple's implementation.
