Mark Rober already was one of my favorite YouTubers, but this video puts him way up there. 

He had some packages stolen from his porch, so his natural solution is to spend 6 months engineering a glitter and fart spray bomb with 4 cameras and GPS. Then, place it on the porch and film people stealing the package, opening it and being sprayed with glitter. Rightful justice. 

And, I shit you not, some thieves even complained about the fact that it exploded and ruined their car or home.
