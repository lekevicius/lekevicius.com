I have been experimenting with [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/), and it works great as a replacement for Adobe Illustrator, when it comes to illustration. For UI design not so much, but for that there is [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch).

Affinity Photo goes directly where Photoshop for photograhy dominates. Again, not meant for UI work, but looks like a great competitor to [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/mac/).
