This page is my "formal" resume. If you want to read a more personal take on my journey so far, I have a [profile page](/profile).

## Work

I have started by building websites with HTML tables in 2004, and soon after discovered Flash. After some years of working as a developer, I have focused on UX/UI design and for about 10 years worked as a product designer. 

In 2022, I have shifted my focus towards blockchain projects.

## Education

I was always interested in both scientific and artistic aspects of computers. Computer science / programming side seemed a lot easier to learn on my own, so I have focused all my education on arts.
