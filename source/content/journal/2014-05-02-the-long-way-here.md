For the last year, my online presence was very minimal: I had two almost identical "web cards", with just links to other web services I use, at [Lekevicius.com](http://lekevicius.com) and [Lekevicius.lt](http://lekevicius.lt), and this website, that only mentioned where I work. The portfolio was never a priority, because I wasn't looking for new work (I still don't), and blog didn't exist, because I didn't like using something like WordPress, Tumblr or writing my own crappy little CMS.

After a little research I discovered static website systems — [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/), and later [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) — and liked the idea quite a lot. These systems produce static HTML (or CSS, JS) files from sources (posts, layouts, SASS and Coffee-script). Everything on this website is served without any PHP or other dynamic code. There's a lot of beauty in such approach: even the cheapest shared hosting can serve hundreds of requests per minute, and the website is virtually unhackable.

At first, I liked nanoc more: it was far more flexible, and could bend source files any way imaginable. However, after spending far too much time trying to implement basic blog functionality, I came back to jekyll and started to appreciate it's simplicity. Jekyll has a far more limited feature set, but getting started with it, and later using it, is much simpler, and requires much less overhead.

There are quite a few interesting things to say about the way I use Jekyll, but that will come in future posts. One question to answer, though, is how I see this blog myself. Topics will include development, design, Apple and tech in general, there will likely be something about movies and TV shows, and so on. This blog is being written for me myself, to capture my interests, thoughts and ideas.

I hope to publish about one article every week, but knowing myself, the regularity of posts will likely be very unstable. There will also be links, and I plan on posting a few every day.

Finally, the website itself will undergo a few changes in coming weeks, as I upload my past and current projects, portfolio, and maybe a few more things.
