Navigation bar title is an icon, and icons beside it show nearby sections further explaining spatial arrangement. When you want to “Like” someone you have to swipe to the left - and to the left is where all your matches are listed. Sliding screens define the app as a series of spaces, and navigating means simply sliding left or right."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The sliding screens can go not only from side to side, but in some cases to other directions. When Snapchat introduced “Discover” a couple of weeks ago, they put this new section in the place of Contacts section. They didn’t hide Contacts under a button, creating an abstraction, a Somewhere place. Instead, they placed profile and contacts above the camera.
